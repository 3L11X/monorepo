          <article>
            Remix PWA evolution now includes loaders and actions that run solely on the worker thread. Utilizing esbuild
            in its new compiler, Remix PWA now seeks to provide a more robust and performant experience for developers.

          <article>
            Worker loaders & actions aren't just restricted to your normal routes, they also work in pathless routes!
            And yes, they have the same behaviour as Remix normal loaders and actions in that they are nested and exhibit
            a waterfall effect. Make sure to 'Log in' else unknown horrors awaits!

          <article>
            Remix PWA now allows you to cache directly in your routes. Talk about finetuning your app's performance!
            In this demo, we would be caching the response from the server and returning it if it's available. If not,
            we would be returning the client's response instead. This is a very powerful feature that allows you to
            cache your responses directly in your routes. See you on the other side of the link ðŸš€!
